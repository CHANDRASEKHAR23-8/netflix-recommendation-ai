# Netflix Content Clustering & Recommendation System

This project uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to cluster Netflix content and recommend similar movies based on textual data.

## Project Features
- Content clustering using K-Means
- Movie recommendation system
- NLP-based text processing
- Visualization of clusters

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Files Included
- netflix_recommendation.py → Main code
- cluster.png → Cluster visualization output
- output.png → Recommendation output

## How it Works
The system analyzes movie title, cast, genre, and description using TF-IDF vectorization.  
It groups similar content into clusters and recommends related movies using cosine similarity.
